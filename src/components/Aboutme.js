                Hello there! My name is Tohur. 
                I am a recent college graduate with a bachelor's degree in computer science. 
                Ever since I learned web programming, I became fascinated by how I could share my skills with the world.
                I am very meticulous about creating quality and attractive products for users.
                </p>
                <p>
                After college, I applied for the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="link">Meta front-end developer course </a> 
                to build on my knowledge in front-end development. 
                </p>
                <p>Here are few technologies I'm working with:
                <ul className="languages">
                    <li>React</li>
                    <li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
                    <li>HTML and CSS</li>
                    <li>Python</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <Image src={photo} alt='Tohur' borderRadius="xl" className="image" />
            </div>
        
            
        </div>
        </FullScreenSection>
    )

}
